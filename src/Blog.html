      <h1>The Mini Cooper SE is a fun EV with some catching up to do</h1>

      <div class="paragraph2">
        <p>
          Electrifying a car like the two-door Mini Cooper seems like a brilliant, forehead-slapping “why didn’t we think of this before” kind of concept and Mini certainly agrees.
         </p>
         <p>
          The brand has been toying with the concept since 2009, with the limited run of the Mini E, a program designed to field test the viability and attractiveness of an all-electric Cooper.
         </p>
         <p>
          Advancements in technology and demand for such a car led to the Mini Cooper SE, a fully electric version of the manufacturer’s stalwart two-door hatch. It’s a first step towards the brand’s recent self-imposed deadline to be fully electric by 2030.
         </p>
         <p>
          The upshot: The Mini Cooper SE is a jaunty car with the playful performance fans of the brand expect, but sadly – and a bit on the nose – retrofitting a long-in-the-tooth hatchback with an electrified powertrain doesn’t get it very far in 2022.

          The Mini Cooper SE is a full battery electric version of the third-generation Cooper or Hatch, as it’s known in other markets, which debuted just two short years ago. The combustion guts of the cheerful two-door have been replaced with its new electrified innards.

        </p>
        <p>
          In lieu of a standard turbocharged engine, the Mini is fitted with an electric motor powering the front wheels, delivering 181 horsepower and 199 pound-feet of torque.
        </p>
        <p>
          In comparison to the rest of the Coopers in the lineup, it’s about on par with the Cooper S and it’s turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder power plant. Power for the SE is stored in a 28.9 kWh battery, providing the SE with roughly 114 miles of range on a full charge. Mini claims the Cooper SE can charge 80% of the battery in roughly 35 minutes on a level 3 DC fast charger, and as much as 20% per hour on a level 2 charger. Basic home outlets can trickle out 2% per hour.
