        Pep Guardiola's ascent from Barcelona B Head Coach to UEFA Champions League winner took place against a footballing backdrop very different to the one we find now in 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following an era where the moment of transition between defence and attack had been pinpointed as the single most decisive action in a match, allowing pragmatic, counter-attacking football to prosper, Guardiola showed that there was another way.
      </p>
      <p>
        He won the La Liga title in three of his four seasons at the Camp Nou and lifted the UEFA Champions League twice.    
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the Catalan giants won the Supercopa de Espana three times, as well as twice lifting the Copa del Rey, the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.

      <h1>Hey I'm Theo ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a Software Developer currently undergoing a Software Development Program in Manitoba Institute for Trades and Technology (MITT) and I'm based in Winnipeg, Canada
      </p>
      <p>
        I was actually studying Computer Science at the University of Alberta in Edmonton but I wanted to really get some practical and hands-on experience, so I took a one-year break to do this program, I was referred to MITT by my mum and I heard it had a one-year Software Development program and how good the program was so I applied for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, to be honest, growing up technology is all I've known as my Dad was a Computer Scientist himself so I really developed an interest in technology at a young age. I really like Artificial Intelligence and the Cyber security field and would like to be involved in something along those lines in the nearest future.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy watching and playing soccer. I like playing video games and listening to music too. Watching anime is my favorite past-time.
