      <p>In this blog, I’ll be giving some strategies to become really good FIFA players.S</p>
      <h3>Be patient in your play</h3>
      <p>
        Usually, for beginners, the best advice I’d give would be to be patient.
        Much as you might like to tear around the pitch playing the most eye-catching tiki-taka football, or lunge into tackles, it’s by taking an extra second and timing your pass or tackle correctly that can make a massive improvement in the success of your offensive and defensive play.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Learn the skill moves</h3>
      <p>
        Every year, with a new edition of FIFA, there seem to be some skill moves that are overpowered and it is important to add them to our game.
        For example:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <p>In FIFA 20 we had the drag backs</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To perform this skill hold the RB or R1 button, and then push the left stick away from the direction you’re facing to drag the ball backward.
              </li> 
              <img src="../images/blog post 4-2 tips to be a better fifa player.jpg" alt="fifa ps4 control buttons graphic">
            </ul>
          <p>In FIFA 19 we had the el’ tornado</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To perform this skill on the PS4, simply hold down the L1 button, and move the Right Analog Stick Upwards and Sideways (corresponding to the direction you want to move the ball to). Similarly, on the Xbox One, hold down the LB button, and move the RS Upwards and Sideways.
              </li>
              <img src="../images/blog post 4-3 tips to be a better fifa player.jpg" alt="fifa ps4 control buttons graphic">
            </ul>
        </ul>
      <p>
        These skill moves come off super quick and are hard to defend against and applying these skill moves to your game would surely give you an edge
      </p>
        
      <h3>Keep Grinding and try to stay positive</h3>
      <p>
        Nothing really comes easy, if you want to become the best, you have to put the time and grind into it. Grinding is key because the more time you put into it, the more you will learn about the game, such as what works and doesn’t work in your game style. You may lose a lot of games along the way but that’s what makes up the learning process.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Practice set pieces</h3>
      <p>
        This may be one of the best tips I would give you. Set pieces are extremely essential and could easily decide a game, especially a game that has been really tight.
        Here is a table showing the set pieces you should practice and how to practice them:      
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Free kicks</th>
            <th scope="col">Throwing</th>
            <th scope="col">Penalties</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>1. Select the right free-kick taker</td>
            <td>1. select your player who’s the farthest from an opponent player</td>
            <td>1. Select the player on your team with the best penalty and shooting stats</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2. Choose the right starting position</td>
            <td>2. You could also fake the throw(throw to another one of your players other than the one who is originally selected)</td>
            <td>2. Choose a specific place to aim and place a powerful shot there</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>3. Make use of the right stick</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>3. Try and outwit your opponent by aiming for a certain area of the post and then changing it at the last minute</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>4. Time your finishes</td>
            <td></td>
            <td></td>
          </tr>
