      <p>
        HTML is short for Hyper Text Markup Protocol. ( It’s one of those acronyms people forget the full meaning because the HTML acronym is so popular.) HTML is the code used to structure a webpage and its content; It’s the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
      </p>
  
      <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
      <p>
        HTML tags are keywords that define how your web browser will format and display content. HTML tags also help web browsers distinguish between HTML content and simple content.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are usually enclosed in these brackets "< >"
        Most HTML tags  consist of an opening bracket, content, and a closing bracket
        For example:
      </p>
      <h4>"<tag>"</h4>
      <p>
        As you can see we first have the opening bracket “<”
        Then the content "tag" 
        followed by the closing bracket  “>”
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use an open tag you usually have to close the tag except in some cases.
        For Example:
      </p>
      <h4>"<tag> ... </tag>"</h4>
      <p>
        As you can see we first have the opening tag "<tag>"
        Then the ending tag "</tag>", 
        which has a slash before the "tag" content 
        unlike the opening content. 
        Don’t worry about what’s between the ellipses it would be explained in the next section
      </p>
  
      <h3>HTML Elements</h3>
      <p>
        HTML Elements are what make up an HTML file. These elements are responsible for creating web pages and define content in that webpage. 
        An HTML element consists of a start tag, some content, and then an end tag
        Like this:      
      </p>
      <h4>"<tag>Hello world</tag>"</h4>
      <p>
        As seen in this example we have the starting tag "<tag>"
        then some content "Hello world" 
        and finally, the end tag “</tag>”
      </p>
  
      <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        HTML Attributes are special words that provide additional information about elements.
        They are specified in the start tag and come in name/value pairs like name=” value ”
        For example:      
      </p>
      <h4>"<tag attribute_name=”value”>content</tag>"</h4> 
      <p>
        As seen in this example we have the starting tag '“<tag”'
        Then the attribute name with its value and the closing bracket of the starting tag “>”
        Some content and then the end tag “</tag>”
      </p>
  
      <h3>Inline Element</h3>
      <p>
        Inline Elements are elements that differentiate the part of a given text and provide it with a particular function.
        The Inline elements don’t start with a new line only takes up as much width as necessary.
        For example:      
      </p>

      <div class="image-container1">
        <img src="../images/blog post 3-html css.jpg" alt="inline element with a hello world graphic">
      </div>
      
      <p>
        The “Hello world” element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Block Element</h3>
      <p>
        Block elements are the elements that structure the main part of a web page, by dividing a page into coherent blocks.
        Block elements always start with new a line and take up the full width of the webpage available from left to right. Browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
        An example of a block element is the <p> element which is used to define a paragraph in an HTML document.
        Here’s how it would look on the webpage.      
      </p>

      <div class="image-container1">
        <img src="../images/blog post 4-html css.jpg" alt="block element with a hello world graphic">
      </div>
      
      <p>
        As seen the <p> element is a block element, and it will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
      </p>
  
      <h3>CSS Rule</h3>
      <p>
        A CSS rule set contains a selector and a declaration block.
      </p>
      <h4>"h1{ color: red; font-size: 12px;}"</h4>
      <p>
        In the code above the “h1” is the selector
        The “color” is the property
        “red” is the value 
        “font-size” is also a property
        “12px” is also a value
        And everything in the curly bracket is the “declaration block”
      </p>
  
      <p>
        To explain the sections above:
        Selector: The Selector indicates the HTML element you want to style. For example, the <p> tag is used to define a paragraph in an HTML document as explained in the Block element chapter.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Declaration Block: The declaration block can contain one or more declarations separated by a semicolon. For the above example, there are two declarations:
      </p>
      <h4>1. color: red;</h4>
      <h4>2. font-size: 12px;</h4>
  
      <p>
        Each declaration contains a property name and value, separated by a colon.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Property: A Property is a type of attribute of an HTML element. Some examples are color, border, etc.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Value: Values are assigned to CSS properties. In the above example, the value "red" is assigned to the color property.
      </p>
