        In this digital age, we find ourselves logging in to a lot of websites and signing in to tons of apps.
        So it is only right that we keep those passwords we use in logging in safe and secured. And one of those ways is:      
      </p>
      <h3>Using unique passwords:</h3>
      <p>
        One of the easiest ways hackers usually steal information is by getting a batch of username and password combinations from one source and trying those same combinations elsewhere. For example, let's say hackers got your username and password by hacking an email provider. They might try to log into banking sites or online stores using the same username and password combination. The sole best way to prevent one data breach from having a ripple effect is to use a strong unique password for every single online account you have.
        Some examples of unique passwords are:

        <img src="/src/images/blog post 3-5password mgt.png" alt="list of unique passwords">
      </div>
      
      <p>One way we could prevent ourselves from getting hacked is to use:</p>
  
      <h3>Password Managers:</h3>
      <p>
        Creating a unique and strong password for every account is not a job for a human. That’s why you use a password manager. Several very good password managers are free, and it takes little time to start using one. However, for-pay password managers generally offer more features.
        Why I would recommend password managers is because when you use them, the only password you need to remember is the master password that locks the password manager itself. When unlocked, the password manager logs you into your online accounts automatically. That not only helps keep you safer but also increases your efficiency and productivity. You no longer spend time typing your logins or dealing with the time-consuming frustration of resetting a forgotten password.
        Some examples of some good password managers are:      
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>LastPass</li>
          <li>Dashlane</li>
          <li>Keeper</li>
          <li>LogMeOnce</li>
        </ul>

          <img src="/src/images/blog post 3-6password mgt.webp" alt="some examples of good password managers graphic">
        </div>
  
      <p>Another way to reduce the chances of being hacked is using:</p>
        
      <h3>Two-factor authentication:</h3>
      <p>
        Two-factor authentication means you need to pass another layer of authentication, not just a username and password, to get into your accounts. If the data or personal information in an account is sensitive or valuable, and the account offers two-factor authentication, you should enable it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although trying to do all these things to keep our passwords safe and prevent getting hacked might be a pain, It’s definitely worth it. Just think of how much personal information we could lose if we get hacked. So it’s definitely worth it to follow these safety measures.
